## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my career project, developing a library management system in Java.
-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning algorithms and data structures, focusing on recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies.
-ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially in Java and React.
-ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing data structures and improving algorithm efficiency.
-ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, linked lists, recursion, and full-stack development.
-ðŸ“« How to reach me: [your email or LinkedIn profile].
-ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: [your preferred pronouns, e.g., He/Him, She/Her, They/Them].
-âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy debugging almost as much as coding! ðŸ˜„
